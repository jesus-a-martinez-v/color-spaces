# Color Spaces

To get started, you'll need to have `Anaconda` installed in your system.

Then, recreate the environment needed to run the notebooks with this command:

```
conda create -n color-spaces --file requirements.txt
```

Activate the environment:

```
source activate color-spaces
```

Finally, run the notebooks (and have fun!)


```
jupyter notebook
```
